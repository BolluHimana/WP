        <h2>Hello all!!</h2>
        <h3>ABOUT ME:</h3>
    </header>
    <p>I'am Shireesha, I'm student of MSIT from 2019-2021</p>
    Education Qualification:
    <ul>
        <li>SSC: Vishwashanthi High School</li>
        <li>Intermediate: Sri Chaitanya Junior College</li>
        <li>B.Tech: Vidya Jyothi Institute of Techonology</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have done my B.Tech from VJIT in ECE, 
        As I'm very intersted in IT so I was wanted to do P.G in IT and that's where I got know about MSIT</p>
    <p>Before going into my msit Journey I just want to say how did I got to know about MSIT</p>
    <h4>HOW??</h4>
    <p>Family..As my sister was a graduate from MSIT, I got to know about the courses they offer and how it was very useful for non-IT students</p>
    Courses Offered :
    <ul>
        <li>Programming languages</li>
        <li>Software development technologies</li>
        <li>Soft Skills</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In MSIT not only programming and software development but also offers soft skills to make students industry ready</p>
    <p>HURREY!!!This is the best part, MSIT environment is completely different from  normal college experience. 
        It is completely like being in an organization by the concept called "LEARNING BY DOING"</p>
